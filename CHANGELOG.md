## <1.2.0> - <2024-04-10>

### Sprint learnings

* Converting a list into string with .join and map for winner's results
* Unittest with TestCase, mock and patch
* Generate a coverage report
* The use of requirement files

### Added
* Unit testing (mock and patch)
* The play again option
* Requirement file

### Changed

* Computer guess number generated by randomint.
* play_rounds() responsibility split into three more functions player_entry(), play_game() and play_again()

### Fixed

* Random number generation (the secret number) changed the way it was called in the play_game() function so it doesn't re-generate
another number in the same single round.
* In the player_entry() return value moved inside the try (It was placed before inside the except)
