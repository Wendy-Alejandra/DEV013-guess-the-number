## <1.1.0> - <2024-04-03>

### Sprint learnings

The use of while and for loops (when to use them)
The use of randint and how the random number change when calling the function directly and how the number remains
the same when calling the function but stored in a variable.
The use of if __name__ == '__main__': code to check if the script is being directly executed and not imported when
testing in the test module.
The use of string formatting f""
